# audio-adventure

Welcome to the Audio Adventure, a Girls Who Code final project made with love in the Bay Area!

Here are some things that are happening right now:
- school. All of our team members are kinda busy, so there's not a whole lot going on at this instant. :(

*The code you'll find in this repository is one part of this project: the other part ("the Box") is a physical object that cannot be easily transmitted through cyberspace, so you won't find it here. The Box is exactly what it sounds like, but better -- it's a custom laser-cut box that houses a Raspberry Pi, which housed our code. It's a self-contained gaming console, complete with USB/audio ports, braille, and clicky buttons! We actually don't have it anymore. It might still be in our classroom at Microsoft. It's out there somewhere. We hope.
