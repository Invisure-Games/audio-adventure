# audio-adventure

Welcome to the Audio Adventure, a Girls Who Code final project made with love in the San Francisco Bay Area!

Here's what's happening right now:
- school. All of our team members are busy seniors, so there's not a lot going on here right now. :(
- but we're still alive; updates still happen when time permits!

*The code you'll find in this repository is one part of this project: the other part ("the Box") is a physical object that cannot be transmitted through cyberspace, so you won't find it here. The Box is exactly what it sounds like, but better -- it's a custom laser-cut box that houses a Raspberry Pi, which in turn houses our code. It's a self-contained gaming console, complete with USB/audio ports, braille, and clicky buttons! It was last seen in our classroom at Microsoft. We know it's out there somewhere.
